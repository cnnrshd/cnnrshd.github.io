      <description>I like to work at the intersection of Security and Automation. I enjoy building content and training. The blog is a work in progress - trying to get the pipeline working well. Expect some oddities (missing images, notes in posts)</description>

      <description>Welcome. This is my blog for the time being.
Content Expect content to be: projects I work on, stuff I do, focused on tech.
Hosting The address (connorshade.com) should never change, but the theme and hosting provider may. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;hosting&amp;rdquo; on Github pages - posts are built with Hugo and I&amp;rsquo;m using the bear cub theme because it seems simple enough. I tried to use Gruvbox but the idea of installing nvm to install node to install npm to install &amp;gt;100 dependencies to compile a webpage is disgusting, despite how nice the page looks.</description>
