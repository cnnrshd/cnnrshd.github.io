<p>Welcome. This is my blog for the time being.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<p>The address (<a href="https://connorshade.com">connorshade.com</a>) should never change, but the theme and hosting provider may.
Right now I&rsquo;m &ldquo;hosting&rdquo; on Github pages - posts are built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearcub/">bear cub</a> theme because it seems simple enough. I tried to use Gruvbox but the idea of installing <code>nvm</code> to install <code>node</code> to install <code>npm</code> to install &gt;100 dependencies to compile a webpage is disgusting, despite how nice the page looks. I also like that <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearcub/">bear cub</a> is light weight (for HTML) - my webapp page is currently ~25kB, from a ~7.8kB source Markdown file, and most of the bloat seems to be styling on the code blocks.</p>
