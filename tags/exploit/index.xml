      <description>Welcome to part three of service-to-shell. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the basics of exploiting DNSSearcher by using Metasploit, along with command stagers, to get a full Meterpreter session on the target. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to cover best practices - if you have a similarly vulnerable webapp, I hope this is a useful tutorial, or something interesting to read.
Research How to get a Metasploit environment If you&amp;rsquo;re running on a machine where you want to install Metasploit (or where it&amp;rsquo;s already installed), this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem.</description>

      <title>Making a Vulnerable Webapp</title>

      <description>Welcome to Part One in my &amp;ldquo;service-to-shell&amp;rdquo; series. I want to make a vulnerable webapp that I can scan with a custom nmap probe and exploit with a custom Metasploit module.
This post covers making the vulnerable webapp - not as exciting as a custom Metasploit module or as useful as an additional nmap banner scanner, but an essential part of the project. For making a vulnerable webapp, the first step is to pick the language (I went with Python), then the vulnerability (Command injection - it&amp;rsquo;s simple to write and understand), and finally the theme.</description>
